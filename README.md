# Weighted_Sampling

This is a faster implementation of the weighted naive sampling in the Julia Distribution packages. Although not faster than the Alias method in general, it can be faster when the number of draws is small compared to the number of possibilities.

Code and benchmarks can be found in the Jupyter file.
